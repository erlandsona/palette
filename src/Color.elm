## Working with `Color`s


### HSL values

HSL is short for hue, saturation, and lightness (or luminosity, or random other
L words depending on who you ask. Think "brightness", and you'll be on the right track).

You may be intuitively familiar with HSL color modeling if you've worked with a
color wheel before. It also may be a great place to start working with color if
you enjoyed playing with unit circles and polar coordinates in trigonometry.

![Representation of HSL values on a cylinder](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/HSL_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png/320px-HSL_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png)
(Image can be seen in context on the [HSL and HSV arcticle on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV). By HSL\_color\_solid\_cylinder.png: SharkDderivative work: SharkD Â Talk - HSL\_color\_solid\_cylinder.png, CC BY-SA 3.0, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9801661>)

HSL models **hue** as a value on a circle. We can pick a hue by providing a degree.
We start at red -- meaning that we can get to red by saying that our hue is 0 degrees or
by saying that our hue is at 360 degrees. Green is at 90, teal is at 180, and
there's a lovely purple at 270.

**Saturation** is how much of the hue is present. When you see a hue of 0 degrees,
a saturation of 100%, and lightness of 50%, your reaction is going to be "Schnickeys! that's red!"
If you change the saturation to 0%, you'll see gray.

**Lightness** is brightness -- 100% is white and 0% is black.

### RGB values

RGB is short for red-green-blue. This representation of color specifies how much
red, green, and blue are in the color.

I found [this chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#/media/File:HSV-RGB-comparison.svg) really
helpful when thinking about how RGB colors work -- it shows red, green, and blue values as piecewise functions
against Hue values. The chart is actually aimed at describing the HSV color space, which is a little
different than the HSL color space, but it may be helpful for your brain too.

As you work with RGB colors, it may also be helpful to know that this color space is **additive**.

This means that if you add red, green, and blue together, you'll end up with white. The more
colors you add, the brighter the result.

This is different than what you may remember from painting in elementary school.
Paint, where you're mixing pigments together, is a **subtractive**
color space. Printing (CMYK color space) is also subtractive.

The hue is specified in degrees, and uses modular arithmetic such that whether you
pass in `0`, `360`, or `-360`, you'll still end up with a red hue.

Saturation is a percentage value. It's clamped between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
Lightness is a percentage value. It's clamped between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
