[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tesk9/palette.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tesk9/palette)

Exploratory package (read: API very subject to change & breakage) for playing with different approaches to modeling and working with Color.

I'm interested in exploring generative accessible palettes, in addition to playing with validating accessibility of existing palettes.


### Maybe TODOs

- Add X11 colors https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names
- What other common web palettes would be helpful to have available? are there others?
- Transparency -- rgba and hsla. worth adding?
